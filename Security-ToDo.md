# OWASP Security Issues

This document lists common OWASP Top 10 security concerns and tasks to address them in the project.

1. **Broken Access Control** - Review authorization logic, use roles and permissions, and ensure routes restrict access appropriately.
2. **Cryptographic Failures** - Verify that sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys) is encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest when needed.
3. **Injection** - Check database queries and other interpreters for unescaped input. Use prepared statements (e.g., Eloquent ORM) to prevent SQL injection.
4. **Insecure Design** - Evaluate overall architecture for security considerations such as rate limiting, secure defaults, and proper security headers.
5. **Security Misconfiguration** - Ensure configuration files do not expose sensitive data. Use secure values for APP_KEY and other secrets in the `.env` file.
6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components** - Keep dependencies up to date using `composer update` and `npm update`. Monitor for security advisories.
7. **Identification and Authentication Failures** - Check authentication logic, password reset flows, and multi-factor authentication options.
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures** - Validate all data inputs, sanitize user-supplied HTML using the provided `Security::sanitizeHTML` helper.
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures** - Implement logging for key actions and monitor logs for suspicious activity.
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** - Be cautious when making HTTP requests to user-supplied URLs.

Use this checklist when reviewing features or dependencies to ensure common OWASP vulnerabilities are addressed.
